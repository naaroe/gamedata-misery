		<text>A popular piece of meat in The Zone favoured over dog meals. Scientific studies have plenty samples already. \n\n%c[default]WARNING:\n%c[255,238,153,26] Stalkers are advised not to eat raw meat as Chernobyl animals carry a high likelihood of passing along trichinellosis or brucellosis. Both wreak havoc on the body in the form of fever, fatigue and appetite loss. Visible signs of abscesses, fungal growth and tumors inside the animal body also mean that you should toss it.</text>

		<text>My guys - Spartacus and his crew. They've been around the block. Some were security guards before coming to the Zone and some even come from special police forces, believe it or not. They know which end of a gun goes boom... If they're available, they'd make a good security detail.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_about_sci_guards_2">
		<text>I'd have a tip for you, but in light of recent events... The Spartacus crew is no more, may they rest in peace.</text>

	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_about_sci_helpers_0">
		<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_about_sci_helpers_1">
		<text>You know Gonta and his guys? Outside their hunting season they... ahem... are happy to take on side jobs. Especially if there's no shooting involved. Their thinking is, "if I feel like having my finger go numb on the trigger, I've always got hunting."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_about_sci_helpers_2">
		<text>Couldn't tell you, really. I would recommend Gonta's crew, but I haven't heard any news of them in a long while.</text>

		<text>How does one survive in this misery?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_1">
		<text>Stick to the fresh food and my hot brewery. It turns out it's a perfect place to grow mushrooms right here on this ship in my own little metal boxes in the back room.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_1111">
		<text>What are people hoping to find here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_11111">
		<text>Ask yourself that. This place offers no time for regrets. No comfort. You will have to look after yourself, that's for sure. Some stalkers are paid to travel here and find certain artifacts... Some have personal goals or dreams.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_1112">
		<text>What drives stalkers to this excluded zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_11121">
		<text>Well, basic human desires - greed and curiosity... Everyone's got their reasons. I'm sure you have yours, too. But if you actually are planning to travel right into the heart of The Zone I must warn you. This place does things to the human mind. Bad things. Maybe you noticed that some men here are kinda strange?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_1113">
		<text>How did you end up here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_11131">
		<text>I came here with Grouse after the Scorcher was disabled. But I'm sure that's not what you really wanna know, am I right? I deal mainly in artifacts. The outside is full of trinkets already, so valuable customers want the rare stuff. That's why I decided to set up a stalker camp, where real high-value articles can still be found. I mean, when a stalker comes back with his loot, what does he really need? A cold one in his hand and good ol' human contact, that's what. And that's what Skadovsk is all about.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_1114">
		<text>It's like bandits are all over this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_11141">
		<text>Well, it's like this. I got nothing against 'em on board the Skadovsk, so long as they act decent. After all, you don't meet total douche bags all that often. Some of them are actually former stalkers. Who knows, one of them poor bastards might actually decide to give up the crook business before he catches a bullet... Life is full of surprises.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_1115">
		<text>Nah, that's okay. Forget about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_actor_info_11151">
		<text>If you say so.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_army_0">
		<text>Has any soldiers showed up here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_army_1">
		<text>Think about it. What would those jarheads be doing in our camp? Trust me when I say that they prefer to steer well clear of this place. Too many of us here remember what it was like to crawl through dirt at the Cordon, under fire from their damn machine guns...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_compass_0">
		<text>Tell me about the Compass.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_compass_1">
		<text>The artifact is the stuff of legends. They say the Compass has no harmful side effects and, if used wisely, can lead you out of any anomaly. You can see why customers would line up to get their hands on it. Just the other day someone told me that Noah knows something about it. He's a stalker who lives south of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_compass_11">
		<text>Okay, I'll pay Noah a visit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_compass_12">
		<text>I'll think about it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_compass_2">
		<text>A legendary artifact, like I told you before. They say a stalker named Noah may know something about it. He lives south of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_halfart_jup_b1_0">
		<text>I picked up a strange artifact not far from Yanov. You interested?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_halfart_jup_b1_1">
		<text>Lemme take a look... Sure is an odd item, but I don't think I'll find a buyer for it. I'd suggest you head back to Yanov and show it to the scientists. Weird shit like this always gets their juices flowing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_new_detector_0">
		<text>Owl says you're not keeping up your end of the bargain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_new_detector_1">
		<text>We had a very clear understanding: I get the detectors, put them to use in the field, and he gets a cut of the proceeds. I've paid him for two detectors already, so I'm fully abiding by these terms. That's the extent of my agreement with Owl. If you're working for him, you can take back the third detector - I'm not buying it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_new_detector_11">
		<text>So what should I tell Owl?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_new_detector_2">
		<text>Suppose so.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_about_new_detector_3">
		<text>I wouldn't deal with Owl if I were you. If you're looking to make a good buck, I can give you a head start in the artifact hunt. Two-three hours - enough to beat all the others. Plus, if you're interested, I've got a special order. You see, I urgently need an artifact called Compass.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_compass_double_dialog_0">
		<text>Sultan managed to intercept the Compass.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_compass_double_dialog_1">
		<text>That bastard's got a bug up his ass... all right, no biggie. Try and talk to Noah again. According to the latest rumors, it might prove... useful.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_compass_give_dialog_0">
		<text>I found a Compass. Here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_compass_give_dialog_1">
		<text>You're a life saver, buddy! Safe to say I've got this big shot customer in my pocket now. Rumors had it that Sultan wanted to take over my business. He's up for a bitter but deserved disappointment. Here, take this - you've earned it fair and square.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_compass_revert_dialog_0">
		<text>I refuse to look for a Compass for you.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_take_business_actor_dialog_0">
		<text>Sultan says hi. By the way, all your supply channels have been shut off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_take_business_actor_dialog_1">
		<text>Now it's obvious who's behind all this... Well, I'm not leaving Skadovsk. Looks like I've got no choice but work for you and Sultan. He'll get his share of the sales, and you'll come daily to pick yours up. The money will be waiting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b30_take_money_actor_dialog_0">
		<text>Give me my share.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b52_about_nimble_1">
		<text>I doubt it... From what I know about him, he prefers to leave the shady stuff to others. A good businessman values his name and reputation. All in all, I've never heard anyone say anything bad about Nimble.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b52_about_snag_0">

	</string>
	<string id="zat_a2_stalker_barmen_b52_about_snag_1">

		<text>The Heart of the Oasis? Nah, I think I'll pass. People say different things... It could be just superstition, but I'd rather keep my distance from it. I think you'd do well to hand it off to the scientists. Let them study it and give us a better understanding of how it affects people.</text>

		<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_himself_1">
		<text>I'm Gonta, leader of the hunting crew. We destroy mutants for cash. We can also capture them alive - for scientific experiments or if anyone needs an exotic pet... As Trapper used to say, "To each animal its own bullet..."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_0">
		<text>Tell me about hunting mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_1">
		<text>Well, I'm not the most seasoned of hunters, but I can tell you a good bit about animals than run in packs. Flesh, boars, blind dogs, pseudodogs, snorks, hamsters... I even know a thing or two about bloodsuckers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_1111">
		<text>Tell me about boars and flesh.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_11111">
		<text>Okay, flesh are the most harmless of mutants. They try to stay away from stalkers, but they'll fight back if you attack 'em. Now, if there's a boar among those fleshes, that spells trouble. Three hundred kilos of rage is nothing to toy with. Try not to stand in its path as it charges at you... Use its momentum against it. A heavy bulk like that won't be able to turn on the dime, will it? Dodge to the side, then plug it full of shot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_1112">
		<text>Tell me about blind dogs and pseudodogs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_11121">
		<text>Lone canines aren't that dangerous, but packs of them are a real pain in the ass. They only attack if they're hungry... the bad thing is, they're almost always hungry. If you're up against a whole pack, try to pick them off from a high spot, else they'll just run you over. Especially if there are mature pseudodogs among 'em. They ain't much tougher than blind ones, but much more cunning and dangerous... If one suddenly turns into a whole pack, then remember: you’re being attacked by phantoms. The real pseudodog will hang back and only try to bite you now and again... Try to identify it. As soon as the real dog is dead, the phantoms will simply disappear.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_1113">
		<text>Tell me about snorks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_11131">
		<text>Remnants of humans... A lone snork isn't much of a problem for an experienced hunter. You wait for him to jump on you and pump him full of shot in the air. Now, when there's a few of 'em... You've gotta just shoot at them as fast as you can while dodging their jumps. They know this and usually try to attack together.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_1114">
		<text>Tell me about hamsters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_11141">
		<text>A hunter's nightmare... The worst thing you can do is underestimate them because of their small size. They're incredibly fast, agile and always run in packs. When you feel dozens of small fangs tearing into you - that's when you stop underestimatin' and start shootin'... And that's the scariest part: they're extremely hard to hit. That's why I always tell stalkers to carry a loaded shotgun.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_1115">
		<text>Tell me about bloodsuckers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_11151">
		<text>They're expert hunters themselves, with excellent disguise. When they're camouflaged you can barely see them. If you're hunting a bloodsucker, try to startle it. You can see it better when it's on the move... Remember, a bloodsucker will try to sneak up behind you and weave its feelers around your neck. That's some creepy shit, man... If you are unlucky enough to run into a few bloodsuckers, always watch your back.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_mutants_1116">
		<text>OK, forget about it.</text>

		<text>What has Magpie done to harm you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_soroka_dialog_1">
		<text>OK, he comes up to me once and says he can't get his loot out 'cause of a controller. My crew was one man short right then. Our pathfinder Danila went off to track bloodsuckers to their lair. So, we decided to help Magpie get his loot and took him hunting with us. All he had to do was keep a lookout for the chimera near the lair...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_soroka_dialog_11">
		<text>And what happened next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_about_soroka_dialog_111">
		<text>What happened next was - the bastard ran away, taking his loot and pocketing ours, too. It was a hell of a surprise when the chimera finally showed up. Garmata, for one, had no time to react. I mean, who would?... Instead of hunting our game, I ended up defending my crew. In the end I wounded the chimera, but it managed to rip Crab a good one and made off. We lost a full week of preparation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_after_fight_11">
		<text>Hunting's in your blood, man! Here's a trophy personally from me... As Trapper used to say, "Skill is your main weapon..." By the way, are you heading to Yanov? It would be nice to tell Trapper the chimera's dead. I'll stay here on Skadovsk for now, wait for Crab to get better. Are you going with us?</text>

	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_after_fight_12">
		<text>We did it. This small trophy is personally from me... It could've been smoother, but that's all right. As Trapper used to say, "With experience, who needs traps?..." By the way, are you heading to Yanov? It would be nice to tell Trapper the chimera's dead. I'll stay here on Skadovsk for now, wait for Crab to get better. You coming with us?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b106_stalker_gonta_after_fight_13">
		<text>Garmata's dead... That chimera cost us dearly. You're not heading to Yanov, are you? We should let Trapper know the chimera's dead. I'll stay here on Skadovsk for now, wait for Crab to get better. You going?</text>

		<text>Tell me about anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1">
		<text>As you approach an anomaly, keep in mind that it's going to be either very hot, or the air will be full of toxic gases, or it will be a radiation hot-spot. There can also be psy-disruptions, but I won't go into those right now. It depends on the nature of the anomaly - be it heat, gas or electricity... or gravity, but I hope you won't have to deal with those. There are also moving anomalies, but that's a different kettle of fish altogether.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1111">
		<text>Tell me about heat anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11111">
		<text>If you see a sort of glimmering, like air steaming over pavement on a hot summer day - that's a heat anomaly. When something gets in it, that spot bursts into an extremely hot flame. At first they thought those were jets of natural gas, but that theory has since fallen into obscurity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1112">
		<text>Tell me about gas anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11121">
		<text>This type of anomaly is dubbed such for its strange, never-ending chemical processes. They produce acid that eats your skin in a matter of seconds, as well as toxic gases that eat your lungs just as fast... Thankfully, gas anomalies are easy to spot out in the open. When you walk into one in a dark tunnel - now that's bad.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1113">
		<text>Tell me about electrical anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11131">
		<text>A very interesting type of anomaly which accumulates a substantial amount of static electricity. Stalkers usually take advantage of the fact that an electrical anomaly can be discharged with any metallic item. They throw a bolt in and dash right through before it charges up again. I prefer to go around - the recharge phase is just too quick.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1114">
		<text>Tell me about gravitational anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11141">
		<text>They are typically stationary. When you look at a particular spot and notice that objects are distorted behind it - you've got one. And you better keep your distance. All three known varieties react instantly, the moment something touches them. Springboard hurls everything from under it - often at a great distance. Vortex does the opposite: it sucks an object in, crushes it with terrible pressure, only to send the bits flying seconds after. Whirligig lifts its victim in the air, spins and tears him to shreds... An unpleasant end, whichever way you go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_1115">
		<text>Tell me about moving anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b215_stalker_guide_about_anomalies_11151">
		<text>Personally I've only come across a Comet and a Tesla. The former is a fireball about three feet in diameter. But I assure you, you'll feel the heat from a much greater distance... The latter is, for lack of a better description, a ball of lightning. It's definitely a ball and it's definitely electrical in nature. Both anomalies always keep moving, but usually in closed-loop paths. A careful stalker should be able to easily go around them... Just don't lose your focus.</text>

Wolfhound was one hundred percent scum, but he knew his weapons, gotta give him that. They say his favorite trick was to blow all four of his victims' limbs off and then his head - before it hit the ground. Anyway, that'll be 2,800.</text>

		<text>Here's your rapid-fire March pistol. You owe me 2,800 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_211">
		<text>Here you go - Cutter, a submachine gun. Let me say it right off, don't you mind the appearance. It's a brand new model, not in serial production yet. It's a prototype, fresh from the armory. The designers aimed to make a new-generation close-range weapon: a combination of high caliber, rapid fire and accuracy. So that'll be 8,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_212">

	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_221">
		<text>Here's a fine specimen - Carabineer. A true army shotgun. Capable of automatic fire while providing good anti-recoil thanks to a balanced, shock-free system. Add 8,000 and it's yours.</text>

		<text>I reckon this is just what you need. Eliminator, a latest development. The whole batch was supposed to be shipped to Central Africa, but I got a 'sample' as a special favor from friends. An automatic shotgun with a large magazine and an excellent rate of fire. Yours for only 8,000.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_232">
		<text>Sure. Automatic shotgun Eliminator, with an extended magazine. For 8,000.</text>

	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_311">
		<text>Sure. Behold Storm, a submachine and grenade launcher in one. This prototype is a modified version of a conventional weapon designed for special units operating in the Zone. Technical innovation at its best from our Slavic brothers... Add 16,000 and it's yours.</text>

		<text>Here it is - GP37, a new-generation assault rifle. Accurate, reliable, and convenient with a built-in optical scope. It was previously owned by a UN observer. Their group was sent to the Zone to investigate. However, the situation turned for the worse... 16,000 and the rifle is yours.</text>

		<text>Just a sec. Here's a modular FT-200M rifle, the brainchild of Belgian gunmakers. Accurate, all-purpose, handy for both righties and lefties, comes with an optical scope and a grenade launcher. I got it from some unlucky UN observers... That'll be 16,000 extra.</text>

	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_411">
		<text>Here's Tide. Based on a silent sniper rifle, it was specifically designed for military units to fight zombies. Tide yields rate of fire in favor of stopping power, allowing the sniper to pick off zombies one by one without disclosing his location. However, it then became clear that stalkers alone will be enough to stop zombies at the Barrier, so the rifle never reached mass production. This baby's yours for an extra 16,000.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Here. This is an SVU2-A, a short sniper rifle with an increased rate of fire. I bought it off Mac, the legendary Freedom guard. He swore there are no others like it in the whole Zone. It's an exclusive item, at least in these parts. It'll be 16,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_422">

	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_431">
		<text>Sure, just look at Lynx here.  Hand-crafted by a local expert. He's deceased now, so there won't be any copies. It looks just like any other rifle, but take it out for some target practice and you'll feel all the difference. It's got a perfect combination of accuracy and stopping power. Add the remaining 16,000 and this baby's yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_432">

		<text>Look here. I managed to get everything off my list - a CS-3a with a helmet. The helmet is nothing special on its own, but it allows for installing a mobile tactical complex, which includes a high-quality night vision system and an active infrared sensor. Now, the CS-3a armor is a real beauty. Excellent protection from bullets and anomalies is a rare feature indeed in a suit as light and mobile as this one. The whole thing will cost you 32,000.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_get_order_512">
		<text>Yeah. A set of CS-3a armor with a tactical helmet. 32,000 in all.</text>

		<text>Specially for you, a SEVA suit. Everything just like you ordered - a closed-cycle respiratory module, thermal resistant, protective electrical circuit, and outer-surface anticorrosion materials. Plus several built-in artifact containers as a bonus. A must-have suit for any stalker. Toss in 24,000 like we agreed and it's yours.</text>

		<text>There it is, a combat exoskeleton as large as life. The best protection you can get in the Zone from bullets, claws or grenade fragments, with the exception of armored vehicles. But it also takes after armored vehicles in that it relieves your weight burden - within reason, of course. 48,000 and it's yours, warts and all... err... by that I mean batteries and servomotors.</text>

		<text>Something for close-range. Like an MP5, Protecta or Spas12. Whatever comes to you first.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_place_order_121">
		<text>Sure thing. The price is 10,000, and I'll need 2,000 of that in advance.</text>

	<string id="zat_b51_stalker_nimble_place_order_122">

		<text>We watch over stalkers. You have to admit that a good half of you are more like little kids than men. You come to the Zone with some silly dreams, or to play heroes, or just because life's treating you badly. You don't realize all that's waiting for you in here -  the grim reaper, mostly. That's the kind we look after. We find one at the Garbage, we take his gear and send 'im back to the Cordon. Some wise up and go back to the outside. Those with the stones to come back here, we put under our protection and we tax 'em. I'm tellin' ya, no one dares go on our territory - not the army, not the mercenaries, not even mutants.</text>

		<text>Our legs. We came here for stalkers, what else? Without us around to keep order it's sheer goddamn chaos. You loot it, you keep it, sure, but who's gonna pay your taxes? You know, the peace and security tax. Like if one of youse is milking an anomaly while we're on the lookout, keeping mutants at bay. If he comes out fine, we take a cut... for maintaining order, you understand.</text>

It's inside a building, but you should act on this tip soon as one of my other men is planning to look for it again. There's ghosts there you know, right? Ha, I guess this could be like a test, seeing if you are capable of doing a search job for me.</text>

		<text>They're all different, like. Some are punks who don't last here a week, others are earners... and others still are okay guys that life has kicked around on both sides of the Cordon. We fleece the first kind, tax the second kind. As far as the last kind, well, we just try not to get in each other's way. Too bad you can't always tell them apart right away...</text>

		<text>To be honest with you, there's not much to tell. Emissions are especially dangerous and almost always fatal. You can feel one coming on gradually, by the changing weather, but it passes soon after hitting its peak. At the first signs of its approach, run for the nearest cover - a cave, something made of concrete, bricks or steel... Like some others, I can feel an emission coming on when my back starts to ache. As for the nature of emissions, I don't have anything useful to tell you - I just don't know.</text>

	<string id="svoboda_light_outfit_name">
		<text>Wind of Freedom bodysuit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_outfit_description">
		<text>This modern version of the Duty bodysuit is better suited for stalker recruits who are used to lightweight suits. Unlike the PSZ series, this suit provides good protection against anomalies while also being capable of stopping a pistol bullet.

	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="mp_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>This bodysuit, intended for conducting research in the Zone, combines a closed-cycle respiratory module and an external isolation coating, resulting in excellent protection from anomalies.

	</string>
	<string id="scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>This suit, produced by one of Kiev's Defense Research Institutes, is a great alternative to homemade stalker suits.

Fully upgradeable and boasting two built-in armour attachment modules, this bodysuit is the equipment of choice for many experienced stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="specops_outfit_description">
		<text>This item comprises military PS5 series body armor with beryllium sputter modified for use in the Zone. Designed for assault operations in highly radioactive areas, it is ineffective in areas of high anomalous activity. The suit makes its way to stalkers through the military, who exchange it for loot.

	</string>
	<string id="stalker_outfit_description">
		<text>This DIY stalker bodysuit is a combination of a bodysuit of twin-layered rubberized cloth with plexiglass lining and built-in body armor.

Comes with built-in armour attachment modules.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armor made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection.

Comes with an armour attachment module.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This early model of the Duty bodysuit is the Spetsnaz PSZ-9 body armor modified for the Zone.

The suit cannot be modified with an armour attachment module, but may be upgraded with a combat support system.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="csky_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>Once used as standard by Clear Sky assault squads, after the faction’s elimination this armor serves as a reminder that even an excellent protective bodysuit cannot guarantee you safety this side of the perimeter. The armor is capable of stopping a pistol bullet, while the wearer is also well protected from anomalies. Comes with a built-in armour attachment module.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="exo_outfit_description">
		<text>An experimental sample of a military exoskeleton. Was never mass-produced due to extraordinary cost and some design flaws.

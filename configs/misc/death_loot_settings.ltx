; --- Survival Chances ---------------------------------------------------------------------

; Papa ScarabParamit say's: IMPORTANT !!!
; All those settings concern items and ammo NPC possess in his inventory
; in moment of his death, so everything he looted also, but not
; items created upon his death.


; when NPC have multiple weapons as loot,
; after the initial [n] the remaining have only [x] chance of survival

; Papa ScarabParamit say's:
; Here you can set modificator which will change ammo and items
; survive chance based on NPC's community, ranks and values set further on...
; without changing their numbers one by one.
; Use this to quickly balance, separate and diversify factions and ranks =)

; Settings DO NOT concerns items spawn on NPC death,
; and will affect only those items and ammunition NPC gathered on his own, has been spawn with,
; have to disposal and possess until his death.
; So before balancing take a look on settings in "death_items_create_chances_by_communities.ltx"
; For best realism and gameplay, same as economy take to consideration
; usefullnes, price, durability and size (hit zone) of objects =]
; 1.0 = 100%
; 0.5 = 50%
; 0.0 = 0%
; Also important to mention is "keep_items" (death_generic.ltx) where we can force certain BASE items
; ( NOT GATHERED but ones NPC is spawned with in the world ) to survive every time NPC is dying,
; if you ask yourself why NPC always keep or have more items than you set, change TRUE to FALSE in death_generic.ltx
; (Proved by veteran stalker constant Rgd-5 grenade spawn upon death,
; easy...change RGD-5 spawn chances to 0 and start a new game...
; kill first two stalkers in front where player has been spawned and the veteran always keep his RGD-5)
; So it's not a bug of a script but an option that could bring little concern.

; Papa ScarabParamit say's:
; Weapon overall condition factor by player level.
; WCF are now used not as a "minimal/maximal" base condition mod. but modificator,
; which randomly set number between first & second value.
; Depending its above, under or same as 1.0 it multiply, divine or live unchanged
; values set for condition based on Community (faction) and Rank of NPC's.
; You can use this to quickly change overall center of lowest vs. higest con.
; aka 'average condition' or rise diversity of looted weapons condition.
; The higer values in WCF & CWC & RWC the higer unpredictability.
; First number - Divine modificator (1.0 <...> OO)
; Second number - Multiply modificator (0 <...> 1.0)
; Number equal 1 - No modificator = Same values
; Number set to 0 - DON'T SET...trust me ^^'
; Examp: 0.5 = divine by half, 1.5 = multiply by half

; Yeas i know how this sound - Weapon Condition Stage Stepping... =P
; This one is WIP for now, might be used as a condition modificator
; changing itself based on player progress in game story.

; -- WC_SS --- ( WIP !!!! ) ---
[weapon_condition_stage_stepping]
stage1 = 1.0
stage2 = 0.9
stage3 = 0.8
stage4 = 0.6


; Papa ScarabParamit say's:
; Those are values for BASE condition depending of 'self explantionary'
; which gonna be sum together and modified (multiply or divine) further by WCF.
; There is minimal and maximal value for easy balance =)
; For easy of imagination: value * 100 = condition %
; Values generated in the end by script can bypas 100 border,
; game will still lower this to 100, but chance of high number
; may be a good way if someone decide to promote certain faction,
; to drop equipment in good condition more often.
; Only equaly balanced values keep same 'average condition':
; min=0% max=100% = 50% average
; min=20% max=80% = 50% average
; min=40% max=60% = 50% average
; Remember, seriously disproportional min/max values in conjuction with WCF
; can occasionally lead to thiner diversity of weapon conditions.
; Example: 
; Faction -> min=0.25 max=0.65 = 25-65%
; Rank -> min=0.20 max=0.45 = 20-45%
; 25-65 + 20-45 = 45-110%   110>100 = 100
; So Army Veteran can posses weapon in condition between 45 nad 100% with average of 77.5%
; If You want to greatly diversify random conditions use WCF, which i present in easy way:
; 45-110 * WCF 0.5 = 22,5-55%
; 45-110 * WCF 1 = same 45-110%
; 45-110 * WCF 1.5 = 67,5-165%
; So with WCF 0.5-1.5 our Army Veteran can end up with weapon in condition between 22,5 or 100 with average of 93.75%
; ...which will lead to serious unpredictability same as high probability of ideal weapon condition.
